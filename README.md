My journey mode world in Terraria.

**DISCLAIMER:** A majority of the builds in this world are NOT MINE. There were only a few original builds by me, each of which should be pretty clear by the quality of the build. I didn't keep track of who the original builders were and I don't feel like looking up each one. 

## How to download
1. Download the .wld file
2. Place the .wld file into the Terraria folder on your PC. The file path should be something like "Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds"
3. When you open Terraria it should be in your worlds list
